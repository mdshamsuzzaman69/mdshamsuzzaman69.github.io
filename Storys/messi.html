      <h2>Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba have been handed one-game sanctions</h2> <br>

  <h1>Messi and Jordi Alba Suspended for One Match by MLS</h1>

  <p>
    In a surprising decision from Major League Soccer (MLS), Inter Miami stars Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba have both received a one-match suspension for failing to participate in the 2025 MLS All-Star Game without prior approval. This disciplinary action will see the legendary duo miss Inter Miami’s crucial clash against FC Cincinnati on Saturday, July 26, 2025.
  </p>

  <h2>Why the Suspension?</h2>
  <p>
    According to MLS regulations, all players selected for the All-Star Game are required to either play or secure an approved exemption from the league, such as due to injury or other legitimate reasons. Messi and Alba, both named to the All-Star roster, were absent from the event and reportedly did not receive formal clearance from the league beforehand. As a result, MLS has imposed an automatic one-game ban, in line with their policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Reaction from the Club</h2>
  <p>
    Inter Miami owner <strong>Jorge Mas</strong> expressed frustration at the decision, describing the rule enforcement as "draconian." He stated that both players needed rest due to a demanding schedule — with Messi dealing with fatigue and Alba nursing a minor injury. “Messi is very upset,” Mas commented. “We hope this doesn’t affect his long-term relationship with the league.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Head coach <strong>Javier Mascherano</strong> echoed the sentiment, noting that the club had not been formally warned in advance about the punishment. “We were prioritizing the health and fitness of our players. Rest was necessary, not optional,” Mascherano said during a press briefing.
  </p>

  <h2>What It Means for Inter Miami</h2>
  <p>
    Inter Miami will now be without two of its most influential players in the upcoming match against <em>FC Cincinnati</em>. The club is in the midst of a tightly packed fixture list, making the absence of Messi and Alba even more significant.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both players are expected to return after serving their suspension, with no additional sanctions anticipated unless further issues arise.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    While MLS maintains its stance on discipline and fairness, the suspension has stirred debate about how flexible the league should be with international stars who carry a heavy workload. As Messi and Alba sit out this weekend’s fixture, fans and pundits alike will be watching to see how Inter Miami responds — both on the pitch and off.
